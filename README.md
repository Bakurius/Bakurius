- 👋 Hi, I’m Shota Bakuridze @Bakurius
- 👀 I’m interested in learning everything around me with just answering one question - why?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning 1. C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on politicions
- 📫 How to reach me... https://www.facebook.com/ 
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I have 146 IQ, higher-order thinking skills ( Bloom's Taxonomy ) and far-sighted thoughts.
  
  D = Discipline
  R = Routine
  E = Education 
  A = Action 
  M = Mentality
  
  E+ ( For me constantly asking why + reading books )
  A+ ( Again, for me it is like making experiments/challanges to myself in order to glow up and shine( Develop ) )
  M+ ( Looking forward with big dreams, with healthy, sophisticated lifestyle and again constantly learning new things, I love learning )

  |||| Dream big. Work hard.
